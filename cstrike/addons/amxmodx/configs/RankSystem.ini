# You can specify different settings for different maps.
# To do this, type in the map name between dashes. Example: - de_dust2 -
# Everything below that line will be read only on the map de_dust2.

[XP Rewards]
# In this section you can determine how much XP are players going to receive on different in-game events.
# You can use any weapon name to determine how much XP a player is going to receive when killing another player with that weapon.
# In addition, you can use a bunch of different predefined keywords such as "headshot" or "bomb_planted".
# You can even use the plugin's API to create your own custom keywords.
# Check the link at the beginning of the file for a full list of available keywords.

# Please note that if USE_COMBINED_EVENTS is set to 1, some of the events will be combined.
# For example: if you kill someone with a headshot with the USP, you will get the XP for "kill", "headshot", and "usp".
# If set to 0, you will get the XP for the event with the highest priority which in the example above is "usp".

# You can set a different amount of XP for users who have the flags set in VIP_FLAGS by separating it with a space.
# Example: kill = 5 7 - this means that regular players will get 5 XP for a kill, while VIP users will get 7.
